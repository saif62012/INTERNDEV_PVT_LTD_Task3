🔍 Exploring Cybersecurity: Sniffing Attacks & Network Scanning 🔍
As part of my remote cybersecurity internship at InternDev Pvt Ltd, I worked on network security assessments using Wireshark and Nmap. These tools play a crucial role in identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing network security.

🚀 Key Learnings
✅ Wireshark helped analyze live network traffic, revealing potential sniffing attacks.
✅ Nmap was used to map active hosts, scan ports, and detect running services.
✅ Identified unencrypted credentials, open ports, and potential security risks.
✅ Implemented mitigation strategies such as encryption, firewalls, and access control.

📌 Takeaway
Cybersecurity is not just about detecting threats—it’s about proactively securing networks. Hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark and Nmap is essential for strengthening security posture and threat response.
